# OsDev

Repository for learning assembly language.
Using various books and tutorials online.
At early stages, work in this repo is experimental, and there is a lot of tutorials, online material
and books used to build the OS (or the attempt to build).

Below is a screenshot of the development stage, as the project has reached up to have a grub file and run in QEMU environment.
